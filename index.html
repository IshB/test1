				Cafés have been established as staples of society in industrialized nations throughout the world. While many may overlook the impact of the café on society, there is no doubt that its contributions have been large. Patrons frequent coffee shops, making a stop at the local Starbucks part of their daily routine. Cafés offer a pick-me-up before work, a reward after a long day, a stimulating environment for creativity and thought, or simply a place to relax and spend time with friends. An investigation of this salient place type offers insight into how and why cafés have become what they are today. An exploration of the goals and successes of coffee shops provide guidelines for the optimal functioning of future cafés. They say successful cafe owners are not made. They are either brewed, percolated or pressed.

				One thing for sure though, all successful cafe owners run profitable cafes. Pass by any busy specialty coffee shop and it will likely be full of customers enjoying coffee, espresso, lattés, teas and a variety of pastries and other goodies. The hugely successful business model of serving quality coffees and snacks in a trendy, relaxing atmosphere is a model pioneered by Starbucks, which has grown to over 25,000 locations around the world. Coffee shops can be big business but to really make it as a successful cafe owner, there may be some home truths you may need to consider. Everyone needs a place to relax and enjoy themselves, so cafes are the perfect place to do it. Tracking such places which help us relax our minds is a necessity for everyone.

				Understanding cafés location is the first step to achieve this. For that we provide a better way to visualize their locations with the help of QGIS. We also perform spatial queries to show things like their location, prices, when they are crowded and ratings. Finally we plot the cafes using the interpolated data. These visuals were restricted to the QGIS platform due to the large amount of data and high processing requirements of web gis. Also, we explore new technologies like QGIS cloud and HERE Studio.
